# Mandelbrot Set

This program creates a simple mandelbrot set by painting points and giving these points colors.
You can also modify the starting parameters. Here I used -2 and 2 as bounds, you can try other values.

To run this program, you need the following packages:

__Grahpics.UI.GLUT__
__Graphics.Rendering.OpenGL__

To compile the code, use 

> ghc --make filename

> /filename**

The idea behind the code comes from The Coding Train Episode 21 (On Youtube).

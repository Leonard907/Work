    "Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment, which enables code to be shared and documented. It supports Julia, Python and R (Ju-pyte-r). A notebook is a collection of *code* and *Markdown* (text) **cells**. We will only give a high-level introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, which will be enough to solve the labs for this course. If you are interested in creating your own notebooks, or you just generally want to get a better understanding, we recommend the following [tutorial](http://bebi103.caltech.edu/2015/tutorials/t0b_intro_to_jupyter_notebooks.html). \n",

    "1. Code in one cell can run, even if there are errors in other cells.\n",
    "2. The order in which these cells are run is important, e.g. if you are calling a function in cell A, which is defined in cell B, cell B needs to be executed before cell A.\n",
    "3. This means that the state of the variables in the notebook can be difficult to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "All objects created by running cells are stored in the *kernel* running in the background. You can restart the kernel by using the Kernel menu at the top of the notebook. Because of the issues with the state of the system noted in the remarks, we recommend that when developing notebooks, you periodically select **Kernel->Restart & Run All** to check that your code really is reproducible. If you run into problems, it can also be a good idea to select **Kernel->Restart & Run All**; the problem might be due to the state of the variables."

You can see the difference between `cleaned_passengers` and `passengers` above."
